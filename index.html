                <p>Since March of 2020, the entire world has dealt with the everyday moral dilemmas of living during a global pandemic. A pandemic of this scale is completely unprecedented for the current generation, so it has not always been entirely clear what the morally responsible choice is in each situation. When social events or travel are in question, the morally responsible choice tends to be not participating. Choosing not to go to a neighborhood barbecue or cancelling a trip I have spent time and money preparing for and weeks looking forward to deeply contradicts my inclination, yet it is the right thing to do. Because we are so emotionally tied to the things that COVID-19 prevents us from doing, it is incredibly difficult to consider these decisions objectively. </p>
                <p>Living through this pandemic entails endless moral conflicts at a micro scale for our day-to-day choices like whether we should go to that barbecue, but it also has wider spread, systemic moral implications. We need a moral framework for processing a pandemic at the macro scale of our government. The officials charged with developing policies face moral dilemmas completely removed from their own personal lives. Should they sacrifice the vulnerable population in the name of keeping the economy afloat, or should they do everything possible to keep that vulnerable population safe at the expense of small businesses nationwide? How should they treat vulnerable people, or those who have COVID-19? Any answer to such questions has consequences of life and death, so it is imperative to have a rigorous ethical framework for acting on these issues. In his work Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals, Immanuel Kant posits an ethical paradigm which considers reason versus inclination and the rules by which humans should treat themselves and each other.</p>

              <div style="font-weight: bold;" class="text-primary">Kant’s principles provide the best moral framework for determining ethical action during COVID-19, with the universal law for guiding individuals’ actions, and the kingdom of ends for informing policymaking and action that affects large groups of people.</div>

                <p>	Kant’s stance on reason versus inclination and the role that each plays in making us happy is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic. The philosopher could not have predicted the circumstances that led to the spread of COVID-19, nor could he foresee whether his ideas would apply centuries later, yet his description of the contradictory relationship between reason, happiness, and inclination so aptly represent the choices we face in this pandemic. Kant writes: “Reason … is not competent enough to guide the will safely as regards its objects and the satisfaction of all our needs … to this end would an implanted natural instinct have led much more certainly. But inasmuch as reason has been imparted to us as a practical faculty … its true function must be to produce a will which is not merely good as a means to some further end, but is good in itself.” (Kant, 9 sec. 396). He claims that reason often does not bring us to overall satisfaction. Following our instinctual inclination would satisfy us better. Reason leads us to good will, rather than comfort and pleasure. Almost every day during this pandemic, we experience this predicament. To satisfy our desires, we could choose to go to a crowded beach, or a bar, or a concert given the opportunity. Reason leads us to the contrary conclusion, knowing that such places are prone to spreading the virus.</p>
                <p>	Empirical data from the Center for Disease Control confirm that going to bars and restaurants contribute to spreading the virus. An article from the Washington Post reports on the spread of COVID-19 at places of gathering. They found a significant relationship between the reopening of bars and a rise in COVID-19 cases 3 weeks later. Also, a CDC report shows that people who tested positive for COVID were twice as likely to have visited a restaurant in the weeks before developing symptoms (Weiner, et al.). Two states that published contract tracing data, Colorado and Louisiana, reported that 20% of COVID cases come from outbreaks in bars (Weiner, et al.).  These statistics prove that bars and restaurants do contribute to spreading the virus, so going to these places is morally reprehensible.</p>
                <p>Having been deprived for the past year of large group settings where we can meet and interact with new people, it is a natural inclination to crave going to bars, restaurants, or. Giving into this inclination would make us the happiest and most satisfied. We would get to interact with people as we did before the pandemic. Unfortunately, COVID-19 is still a threat, so reason still leads us to conclude that going to bars, concerts, or other heavily crowded areas is still not morally responsible. Kant perfectly encapsulates this dilemma with his description of reason. The goal of our natural inclination is satisfaction, which would make us the happiest. Reason, however, considers the impacts of our actions outside of ourselves, which can have an inverse relation to our inclination. It helps us act on good will and leads us to the morally responsible choice.</p>

                <p>	It is clear why going to places of mass congregation is not safe, but what about decisions that do not have as clear an answer, like driving to Portland to meet one friend who lives out of state? Maybe they say they have been careful with who they choose to see, and the Colby student who wants to drive to meet them has the security and privilege of frequent testing. Kant’s principle of the universal law helps us answer these questions of moral ambiguity.</p>
                <p>	Kant claims that humans decide to act based on imperatives and maxims. An imperative is simply a command on which one acts. A maxim is a rule that leads someone to arrive at an imperative. Maxims have no inherent moral content and they are easily subject to the inclinations of the person creating them (Kant, 20, sec. 422). Our inclinations cloud our judgement, making it hard to act morally. Acting morally involves following what Kant calls the categorical imperative: “there is only one categorical imperative and it is this: Act only according to that maxim whereby you can will that it should become a universal law.” (Kant, 30, sec. 421). Kant claims that you should not act on a rule unless you imagine what would happen if every person were to justify actions per that same rule and no negative consequences would follow. Checking our reasoning against the categorical imperative helps keep us in check. If our maxim would lead to bad results, then we should not act on it. Considering whether a Colby student should drive to see their friend, we quickly see that the justification breaks down when you consider it universally. If everybody were to cross state lines to see their friends during the COVID pandemic, then COVID could not be contained. Kant would say that it cannot be a universal law so it does not comply with the categorical imperative and, therefore, it is immoral.</p>

                <h3>Micro Scale / 
                  <span class="text-primary">Formula for Humanity</span>
                </h3>
                <p>	Having established that actions are morally reprehensible if the maxims which justify them cannot apply as a universal law, the next step is to ask: what sort of rules can apply as a universal law? Kant’s formula for humanity aids us in resolving this question. He writes: “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or the person of another, always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means.” (Kant, 36, sec. 429). With this assertion, Kant recognizes that every human deserves respect and has a right to live and they should not be exploited. Following this principle ensures the morality of your actions. Once again, this is especially pertinent during COVID-19, when treating someone else as a means—for example, putting someone at risk for contracting the virus as a byproduct of you achieving personal satisfaction by going to a bar—could cost a life. </p>
                <p>The formula for humanity manifests in choosing whether to wear a mask. In the article Moral Reasoning in a Pandemic, F.M. Kamm discusses the moral implications of mask-wearing. The masks which most people wear “do not primarily protect the wearer from getting COVID-19. Rather they reduce the chances of transmitting the virus to others” (Kamm). When you choose not to wear a mask, you benefit from others wearing a mask without reciprocating the protection. This effectively treats those other people “simply as a means”. Kant would say this is an immoral choice. When you also wear a mask, the protection is mutual, so you treat them as a means as well as an end. Kant specifies that actions are immoral if you treat someone as a means without also treating them as an end. It is okay for a person to be a means to your end, as long as you reciprocate that means for them in some form.</p>

                <h3>Macro Scale / 
                  <span class="text-primary">Kingdom of Ends</span>
                </h3>
                <p>So far, we have seen how Kant’s principles concern morality at an individual level, but what about a larger scale? The people in charge of making rules for us all to follow during a pandemic face unique moral dilemmas because their actions have widespread and indirect impacts. Many people take great stake in the recommendations from the CDC and public officials, so they have a greater duty to make morally sound choices. The formula for humanity also helps in making these impactful decisions. Throughout the pandemic, state officials have imposed statues intended to slow the spread of COVID-19. The first statutes which we all experienced came last March, when “non-essential” businesses closed down and we were ordered to stay at home. Kant’s formula for humanity can help us assess the morality of these mandates through the kingdom of ends, which extends the formula for humanity from a single person to the network of all people. Kant defines it as: “a systematic union of rational beings through common laws” (Kant, 39, sec. 433). Each member, having the innate ability to act on good will, can thus realize a universal law. By “laws”, Kant refers to the maxims on which an individual acts rather than formal laws or statues passed by public officials, but it would still help to consider the kingdom of ends in writing legislation. Kant speaks on the morality of action: “morality consists in the relation of all action to that legislation whereby alone a kingdom of ends is possible.” (Kant, 40, sec. 434). If the laws and statues enacted by public officials are in accord with the kingdom of ends, then we can all act morally by obeying them.</p>
                <p>The stay-at-home orders issued in states across the nation also sparked heated controversy and faced ardent resistance. As the United States began to adapt to the pandemic and get used to the ways we can limit COVID’s spread states lifted their stay-at-home orders and people started going out again. Elderly people and other vulnerable people with compromised immune systems were largely excluded from the country opening up again. In many cases, retirement communities are closed down and hospitals do not allow visitors. The CDC’s guidelines for protecting the elderly and vulnerable include “Limit your in-person interactions with other people as much as possible” (Older Adults and COVID-19). The narrative is clear: vulnerable people should isolate so they are protected. Perhaps confinement best protects them from the virus, but we must consider the ramifications of this narrative. Once again, the kingdom of ends can aid us in determining what the most ethical course of action is towards vulnerable people. </p>
                <p>The Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University released a special issue exploring these moral concerns of confinement. Although confinement protects the vulnerable, it sacrifices many of their freedoms and negatively affects their mental health (Continued Confinement). Making all vulnerable people self-isolate does not respect those in confinement as an end. We should afford all people the same rights and treat them as an end, regardless of how susceptible they are to COVID-19. We should aim to strike a balance between protecting the vulnerable while still affording them rights (Continued Confinement). Finding that balance requires a collective effort from all people to reduce the spread by maintaining hygiene in public areas and following social distancing precautions (Continued Confinement). This approach respects the freedoms of vulnerable people and non-vulnerable people alike and does not deliberately condemn any single group to confinement as a means for protection for the rest. Lastly, we must consider the fact that vulnerable people carry a higher risk for contracting the virus and thus a higher risk for spreading it. Shifting perspective to the less vulnerable people, one could argue that vulnerable people have a duty to isolate to protect everyone else. The key here is that confinement should be voluntary, but in the event that anyone gets sick, they have a duty to isolate themselves so they do not spread it.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Utilitarianism</h2>

          <div class="resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row mb-5">
            <div class="resume-content mr-auto">
              <div class="text-body">
                <p>Kant’s guidelines for morality hinge on widespread compliance with ideals. Many see that as a weakness in his ethical framework. An alternative framework that concerns only practical matters outside of ideals is utilitarianism. The article Utilitarianism and the Pandemic, in the journal Bioethics, defends the practical strengths of utilitarianism. A pandemic comes with incredibly difficult questions to answer, like who should receive priority for vaccines? How should we distribute limited medical resources? This article suggests a few key factors to consider in answering these questions. Utilitarians consider things quantitatively: “One utilitarian rule of thumb is to save the greatest number (other things being equal)” (Savulescu, et al.). The article also presents a metric called quality adjusted life years (QALYs), which takes into account the quality of life of people saved (Savulescu, et al.). The quantitative nature of these metrics allows for direct comparison, and thus an easier time making hard decision. Utilitarians have an easy time deciding whether a young and able bodied person should receive treatment, or a person in a nursing home. They also easily assess the impacts of an economic shutdown through net aggregation of economic suffering versus QALYs, as referenced by economist Nick Bloom.</p>
                <h4>Objection</h4>
                <p>I can imagine a well-informed philosopher arguing that Kantian ethics are far too idealistic to hold any real practical value. Utilitarianism is a better framework for making moral decisions in a pandemic because it gives hard and fast answers when weighing outcomes at a large scale. It acknowledges that not everybody is going to do the right thing. It works within the bounds of the way things are, not how they could ideally be.</p>
                <h4>Refutation</h4>
                <p>These are valid points in support of utilitarianism—it allows for less ambiguity and easier decision making, but it is not always morally sound. Utilitarianism lends itself to deliberately sacrificing the lives of some for a marginal benefit to many, simply because the marginal benefit measures a large aggregate good. Utilitarianism also holds the outcome of an action as the highest priority; rights and privacy are not necessarily preserved (Savulescu, et al.). It holds very little faith in humanity’s collective ability to act on good will. Kant’s ideas preserve the well-being of the masses without any deliberate sacrifices. Utilitarianism reduces people’s lives to statistics, while Kant’s ethical framework emphasizes the importance of a single human life. It may be true that his principles are idealistic, and the kingdom of ends may never be brought to life, but partial compliance can yield a positive outcome.</p>

                <p>With the current rate of vaccination in the United States and decline of infection rates, it appears that we may be at the tail end of this pandemic. Other countries around the world still face severe outbreaks, and COVID still continues to kill people in the United States. The ethical dilemmas have not come to an end. To resolve these dilemmas, we should turn to Kant. He reminds us to treat one another with respect, regardless of how others can serve you. The formula for humanity is a principle to live by, and the kingdom of ends is something all governments should strive for.</p>
